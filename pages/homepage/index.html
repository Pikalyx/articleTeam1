          <h3>Why Does Gen Z Want To Redefine The Workforce?</h3>
          <p>While commuting to an event one day, I overheard two people venting their frustrations. Both sighed about wanting to work comfortably in their own home.
            One of them said, <em>“I'm just counting down to Friday so I can have the weekend to myself.”</em> Later that same day, I attended an A+E Networks media event and 
            witnessed a surprising scene. Three employees playing ping pong with one another. Though they kept missing the ball, the trio were having a blast with one another. 
            Witnessing these events on the same day made me realize something. Gen Z wants to be in jobs where they can feel liberation.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Gen Z's demand for work-life balance</h4>
          <p>For Gen Z, flexibility isn't a perk, it's a priority for them. We've seen what the lack of flexibility does to people. From people ranting on TikTok or even talking 
            about it in their actual workplace. Some even have emotional meltdowns online. In a 2024 study conducted by LinkedIn, <strong>73% of Gen Z have left or considered leaving a job</strong>
            that didn't have flexible policies. A 2024 Deloitte report adds that 63% prefer hybrid work for better work-life balance. When it comes to time, Gen Z are drawing boundaries. To them their 
            time is worth more than gold, something they can't get back. They see this as a necessary step to maintain their mental health and productivity. It's a plea to avoid the cycles of exhaustion 
            that previous generations endured and viewed as normal.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Purpose Versus Paycheck</h4>
          <p>People from older generations think of jobs as climbing up the corporate ladder. However, the younger audience has a different take. They tie their work to purpose instead 
            of a paycheck. According to a study conducted by Deloitte Global, 86% of Gen Zers want a sense of purpose in their work. Shockingly, in a Pew Research Study, 70% say that they 
            are willing to be paid less to work for organizations whose values align with theirs. These values include things like environmental impact, diversity (DEI), mental health advocacy, 
            and more. 44% mentioned how they were willing to reject a job offer if the company's ideals clash with theirs. It's evident that there's a shift from wanting just a paycheck to instead 
            wanting a purpose and change. Gen Z views themselves as stakeholders rather than just workers.</p>
          <br>
          <h4> The Shift In Workplace Culture</h4>
          <p>To older generations, asking for a nap room, ping-pong, or even pet friendly environments at work sounds frivolous. To Gen Z these “frivolous” ideas are a symbol of respect. At the A+E 
            media event, I saw firsthand how a joyful environment promotes both productivity and collaboration.</p>
          <p>The truth of the matter is this generation values mental health, flexibility, and community just as much as salary and benefits, sometimes even more. In a New York Post survey, nearly 
            1 in 6 Gen-Zers won't consider a job without a designated nap space at their workplace. 1 in 5 Gen Z workers say having a "fun room" with games is essential. 33% of Gen Z expect free snacks 
            and lunches at work, more than any other group.</p>
          <p>Even with perks companies may offer, many still resist returning to traditional office settings. 1 in 4 people want extended sabbaticals for personal development or even travel. 20% won't 
            consider a job unless the office allows pets. These "frivolous" ideas allow people to integrate work, wellness, and passion together. In fact, at the A+E media event, Paul Bucceri talked about 
            how he didn't believe in work-life balance. He instead, found ways to integrate his life with work. He once took his daughters out of school for a road trip while working.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Let People Breathe </h4>
          <p> Overall, Gen Z's expectations at work may seem to be idealistic. However, they have experienced the pandemic, social justice issues, burnout and other issues. This isn't about finding ways to 
            do less work, rather it is about finding a system that nurtures their productivity. If employers decide to ignore these pleas they risk missing out on a generation who are socially aware and mentally 
            conscious. Instead, let's stop trying to cling onto outdated norms and start building a workforce based on new innovative ideas.</p>
