          <h2>Gen Z Expectations For The Workplace
            <br><em>
              Gen Z Isn’t Settling — They’re Redefining Work
            </em>
          </h2>
          <h3>By: Raisa Hoque</h3>
          <br>

          <p> For Gen Z, work is more than a paycheck. They're looking for a purpose, balance, and a job that fits their
            needs, not the other way around. Generation Z, born roughly between 1997 and 2012, is now entering the
            workforce in full force. This generation came of age during a time defined by constant financial, political,
            and economic upheaval in the United States. Many watched their families struggle through the 2008 financial
            crisis, grew up under the shadow of rising student debt, and entered adulthood just as the COVID-19 pandemic
            upended traditional work and life expectations.
            <br><br>
            As a result, Gen Z workers are fundamentally reshaping what work should look like. They want more than just
            a paycheck: they seek jobs that align with their values, offer flexibility, protect their mental health, and
            contribute to a larger mission they believe in. Unlike previous generations, Gen Z expects their work to
            adapt to them and is unwilling to bend their lives to fit outdated corporate norms. Employers that fail to
            offer purpose, growth, and real work-life balance risk falling behind in a competitive job where Gen Z
            workers have more choices and higher expectations than ever before.
            <br><br>
            So what exactly does Gen Z want? According to Handshake, flexible schedules and strong mental health
            benefits top their list. For this generation, flexibility isn’t just about remote work: it’s about having
            real control over when and how they work so they can manage stress, protect their mental health, and make
            time for priorities outside the office. Many want the freedom to design work around life — whether that
            means four-day workweeks, adjustable hours, or hybrid options that respect their time and well-being.
            <br><br>
            As Nur, an Opportunity Network Fellow and a recent college graduate, explained, <em>“I want to work
              hard, but I also want time for friends, family, and my own hobbies. Balance keeps me motivated.”</em>
            Flexible schedules are just the start, Gen Z also expects employers to take mental health seriously.
            <em>Knowing I can take a mental health day or get support if I need it makes me feel like the company
              actually cares,”</em> Nur added, a view supported by research from Handshake and Deloitte, which found
            that burnout and stress are top concerns for this generation.
            <br><br>
            Handshake’s survey also shows Gen Z expects their employers to acknowledge and address urgent
            social issues, from racial justice and gender equality to climate action and community well-being. They’re
            more likely to choose and stay with companies that take public stands on causes that align with their
            values, instead of staying silent. As Nur shared, <em>“It matters to see people with different backgrounds
              at all levels. It makes the workplace feel more welcoming and fair.”</em>
            <br><br>
            But flexibility, well-being, and social impact are only part of the picture. Research from Stanford
            and EY highlights other top priorities: clear communication, meaningful feedback, and authentic leadership.
            Gen Z wants managers who check in often and invest in their growth, not just once a year. They also want
            freedom to pursue side projects, travel, and build a career that fits into a life. <em>Good leadership and
              clear growth paths. That’s what would make me stay long-term,”</em> Nur said, echoing what many surveys
            confirm. Gen Z wants to see where they’re going, and how they’ll get there.
            <br><br>
            Yet while Gen Z knows what they want, the traditional advice they get in college or from older
            generations doesn’t always match. As Nur noted, <em>“Professors and career offices give helpful advice, but
              sometimes it feels a bit out of touch.”</em> That’s exactly where programs like The Opportunity Network
            (OppNet) step in to close the gap. OppNet understands that young people need more than just generic career
            advice, they need real-world guidance that reflects what today’s workplaces actually demand. Through
            one-on-one coaching, mock interviews, networking opportunities, and practical resources like curated job
            boards, OppNet helps Gen Z build the skills and confidence to find roles that offer flexibility, strong
            mental health support, and inclusive cultures. Fellows like Nur benefit from a community of peers and
            mentors who share insights about negotiating for better conditions, asking the right questions during
            interviews, and advocating for growth opportunities once on the job. By combining career prep with a deep
            focus on equity, access, and personal development, OppNet equips Gen Z with the tools they need to shape
            their own careers — and push workplaces to meet them where they are.
            <br><br>
            At the end of the day, Gen Z is asking for more than trendy perks. They’re looking for workplaces
            that respect their lives, support their well-being, and stand for the values they believe in. Employers and
            educators who listen and adapt will be the ones who don’t just attract Gen Z — they’ll keep them motivated,
            loyal, and ready to lead the future of work.

            A quiet game about choices, silence, and being seen. In this game, you step into the story of a student
            navigating the unspoken codes of opportunity—applications, rejections, performance, and the subtle rules
            that shape belonging. Each decision branches from emotion, not strategy. Whether you apply or not, speak or
            stay silent, the game holds space for all paths. This is not a game to win. It’s a space to feel your way
            through. To be seen—even when you don’t say a word.

            You're about to graduate high school… Now what? Post-Grad Pathfinder is an interactive story game where you
            explore real-world decisions about life after high school. Whether you’re headed to college, looking for a
            job, considering a gap year, or unsure about your major, this game places you in the shoes of a graduating
            Fellow navigating these paths. Through conversations with mentors, experiences on campus, internships, peer
            advice, and even moments of doubt, you’ll uncover what feels right for you. The game is built to reflect
            real-life complexities, there’s no one-size-fits-all route here. Make choices, gather knowledge, and carve
            out your next chapter on your terms.

            In the game, the player has an upcoming interview in two days for an internship they applied for, but they
            have never done an interview before. They have a variety of choices to choose from in order to prepare them
            for the interview. But be careful as they take up your time depending on the choices you made. You may or
            may not be able to go through all the choices, and different choices will lead to different levels of
            preparedness, which is important when the day for the interview comes. Depending on your choices, especially
            on interview day, you may secure the internship position. Good luck!
