          <h2>Gen Z in the Workplace</h2>
            <p>As Generation Z steps into the workforce, they’re bringing a new set of expectations that are shifting the culture of employment. Unlike previous generations who prioritized job security, longevity, and climbing the corporate ladder, Gen Z is focused on purpose, flexibility, mental health, inclusion, transparency, and growth. These priorities aren’t based on entitlement, but rather on the social, economic, and technological environment they grew up in. This generation has come of age in a world marked by climate change, racial justice movements, student debt, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the rise of artificial intelligence. As a result, they have redefined what a fulfilling and sustainable career looks like.</p>
            <p>One of the strongest expectations Gen Z holds is that work must carry meaning. According to Deloitte’s 2024 Global Gen Z and Millennial Survey, 86% of Gen Z respondents said that having a sense of purpose is a key factor when choosing an employer (Deloitte, 2024). Gen Z wants to work for companies that do more than generate profit — they want to contribute to something that matters. One student I interviewed shared, “I need to feel like what I’m doing actually matters. I don’t want to work somewhere that just cares about profit.” This sentiment reflects a broader desire among young professionals to align their careers with their personal values, whether that’s sustainability, equity, or community impact. When companies fall short of this alignment, Gen Z isn’t afraid to disengage or walk away.</p>
            <p>Flexibility is another non-negotiable. The pandemic showed this generation that traditional office models aren’t the only way to be productive. As a result, remote and hybrid work structures are now seen as standard. A report by McKinsey & Company found that 77% of Gen Z workers prefer hybrid or remote arrangements and consider flexibility a critical component of job satisfaction (McKinsey & Company, 2022). Another interviewee stated, “I want flexibility, like the option to work from home at least part of the week. I don’t see myself doing a strict 9 to 5 every day in an office.” For Gen Z, flexible work signals trust and autonomy. It allows them to structure their days in ways that support both their personal lives and productivity, which can, in turn, build loyalty to the employer.</p>
            <p>In addition to flexibility, mental health support is a major priority. The American Psychological Association reported in 2023 that Gen Z experiences higher levels of stress than any other generation, largely due to work-related anxiety and financial uncertainty (APA, 2023). As a result, this generation expects mental health resources to be built into their benefits. One respondent emphasized this need, saying, “For me, mental health benefits are just as important as the salary. If I’m burnt out, I won’t be productive anyway.” Employers that offer counseling, mental health days, and emotionally intelligent leadership are more likely to retain Gen Z workers, while those who fail to support emotional well-being risk high turnover and disengagement.</p>
            <p>Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are also top concerns. A 2023 survey by Monster found that 83% of Gen Z candidates consider a company’s commitment to DEI as a major factor in accepting a job offer (Monster, 2023). Gen Z expects meaningful representation at all levels of leadership, inclusive hiring practices, and safe environments for people of all identities. But they also demand authenticity. If a company makes surface-level DEI claims without action, they’re likely to be called out — often publicly. Gen Z is unafraid to use social media as a tool for accountability, and performative behavior is quickly exposed.</p>
            <p>Professional development is another key expectation. Gen Z doesn’t want to be stuck in repetitive roles with no clear path forward. Instead, they want consistent feedback, mentorship, and access to learning opportunities. According to LinkedIn’s Workforce Confidence Index, 76% of Gen Z professionals believe that ongoing learning is essential to career success (LinkedIn, 2022). One peer I spoke to said, “I expect regular feedback and chances to grow. If I’m stuck doing the same thing for a year, I’m gone.” This generation views skill-building not just as a career benefit, but as a necessity for survival in an ever-changing job market. Transparency and communication from leadership also matter. Gen Z wants honesty about company performance, expectations, and decisions that impact their roles. PwC’s 2023 Future of Work report found that Gen Z employees value open conversations with managers, including regular feedback and clarity on goals (PwC, 2023). Given that they’ve grown up with constant access to information online, they expect the same openness within their workplaces. Companies that lack transparency risk damaging the trust Gen Z considers foundational.</p>
            <p>Finally, Gen Z’s expectations are being shaped by the growing influence of artificial intelligence on hiring and job security. Several of the students I interviewed expressed frustration about AI’s role in the application process. One shared, “It’s crazy. Entry-level jobs now require three years of experience, or worse, they’re just being automated.” Another said, “I’ve applied to over 50 jobs and barely heard back. Sometimes I wonder if a bot even looked at my résumé.” These quotes reveal a sense of discouragement and anxiety, particularly for recent graduates who feel overshadowed by algorithms and automation. “It’s like I studied for four years just to lose out to a robot in the application process,” one student said. Another added, “I feel like AI is moving faster than schools can teach us. We’re graduating behind.”</p>
            <p>In conclusion, Gen Z’s workplace expectations reflect a shift toward a more human-centered, value-driven, and transparent approach to employment. They want flexibility, purpose, mental health support, DEI, growth, and honesty. These are not demands for special treatment, but rather a reflection of how the world has changed and what a sustainable, fulfilling career now looks like. Employers who adapt to these expectations will not only attract top Gen Z talent but will build stronger, more resilient organizations for the future.</p>

            A quiet game about choices, silence, and being seen. In this game, you step into the story of a student
            navigating the unspoken codes of opportunity—applications, rejections, performance, and the subtle rules
            that shape belonging. Each decision branches from emotion, not strategy. Whether you apply or not, speak or
            stay silent, the game holds space for all paths. This is not a game to win. It’s a space to feel your way
            through. To be seen—even when you don’t say a word.

            Fellow navigating these paths. Through conversations with mentors, experiences on campus, internships, peer
            advice, and even moments of doubt, you’ll uncover what feels right for you. The game is built to reflect
            real-life complexities, there’s no one-size-fits-all route here. Make choices, gather knowledge, and carve

            In the game, the player has an upcoming interview in two days for an internship they applied for, but they
            have never done an interview before. They have a variety of choices to choose from in order to prepare them
            for the interview. But be careful as they take up your time depending on the choices you made. You may or
            may not be able to go through all the choices, and different choices will lead to different levels of
            preparedness, which is important when the day for the interview comes. Depending on your choices, especially
            on interview day, you may secure the internship position. Good luck!
