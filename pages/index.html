          <h2>Gen Z Expectations For The Workplace
            <br><em>
              Gen Z Isn’t Settling — They’re Redefining Work
            </em>
          </h2>
          <h3>By: Raisa Hoque</h3>
          <br>

          <p> For Gen Z, work is more than a paycheck. They're looking for a purpose, balance, and a job that fits their
            needs, not the other way around. Generation Z, born roughly between 1997 and 2012, is now entering the
            workforce in full force. This generation came of age during a time defined by constant financial, political,
            and economic upheaval in the United States. Many watched their families struggle through the 2008 financial
            crisis, grew up under the shadow of rising student debt, and entered adulthood just as the COVID-19 pandemic
            upended traditional work and life expectations.
            <br><br>
            As a result, Gen Z workers are fundamentally reshaping what work should look like. They want more than just
            a paycheck: they seek jobs that align with their values, offer flexibility, protect their mental health, and
            contribute to a larger mission they believe in. Unlike previous generations, Gen Z expects their work to
            adapt to them and is unwilling to bend their lives to fit outdated corporate norms. Employers that fail to
            offer purpose, growth, and real work-life balance risk falling behind in a competitive job where Gen Z
            workers have more choices and higher expectations than ever before.
            <br><br>
            So what exactly does Gen Z want? According to Handshake, flexible schedules and strong mental health
            benefits top their list. For this generation, flexibility isn’t just about remote work: it’s about having
            real control over when and how they work so they can manage stress, protect their mental health, and make
            time for priorities outside the office. Many want the freedom to design work around life — whether that
            means four-day workweeks, adjustable hours, or hybrid options that respect their time and well-being.
            <br><br>
            As Nur, an Opportunity Network Fellow and a recent college graduate, explained, <em>“I want to work
              hard, but I also want time for friends, family, and my own hobbies. Balance keeps me motivated.”</em>
            Flexible schedules are just the start, Gen Z also expects employers to take mental health seriously.
            <em>Knowing I can take a mental health day or get support if I need it makes me feel like the company
              actually cares,”</em> Nur added, a view supported by research from Handshake and Deloitte, which found
            that burnout and stress are top concerns for this generation.
            <br><br>
            Handshake’s survey also shows Gen Z expects their employers to acknowledge and address urgent
            social issues, from racial justice and gender equality to climate action and community well-being. They’re
            more likely to choose and stay with companies that take public stands on causes that align with their
            values, instead of staying silent. As Nur shared, <em>“It matters to see people with different backgrounds
              at all levels. It makes the workplace feel more welcoming and fair.”</em>
            <br><br>
            But flexibility, well-being, and social impact are only part of the picture. Research from Stanford
            and EY highlights other top priorities: clear communication, meaningful feedback, and authentic leadership.
            Gen Z wants managers who check in often and invest in their growth, not just once a year. They also want
            freedom to pursue side projects, travel, and build a career that fits into a life. <em>Good leadership and
              clear growth paths. That’s what would make me stay long-term,”</em> Nur said, echoing what many surveys
            confirm. Gen Z wants to see where they’re going, and how they’ll get there.
            <br><br>
            Yet while Gen Z knows what they want, the traditional advice they get in college or from older
            generations doesn’t always match. As Nur noted, <em>“Professors and career offices give helpful advice, but
              sometimes it feels a bit out of touch.”</em> That’s exactly where programs like The Opportunity Network
            (OppNet) step in to close the gap. OppNet understands that young people need more than just generic career
            advice, they need real-world guidance that reflects what today’s workplaces actually demand. Through
            one-on-one coaching, mock interviews, networking opportunities, and practical resources like curated job
            boards, OppNet helps Gen Z build the skills and confidence to find roles that offer flexibility, strong
            mental health support, and inclusive cultures. Fellows like Nur benefit from a community of peers and
            mentors who share insights about negotiating for better conditions, asking the right questions during
            interviews, and advocating for growth opportunities once on the job. By combining career prep with a deep
            focus on equity, access, and personal development, OppNet equips Gen Z with the tools they need to shape
            their own careers — and push workplaces to meet them where they are.
            <br><br>
            At the end of the day, Gen Z is asking for more than trendy perks. They’re looking for workplaces
            that respect their lives, support their well-being, and stand for the values they believe in. Employers and
            educators who listen and adapt will be the ones who don’t just attract Gen Z — they’ll keep them motivated,
            loyal, and ready to lead the future of work.

          <h2> Why Does Gen Z Want To Redefine The Workforce?

            <br>
          </h2>
          <h3>By: Ina Chen</h3>
          <br>

          <h3>Why Does Gen Z Want To Redefine The Workforce?</h3>
          <p>While commuting to an event one day, I overheard two people venting their frustrations. Both sighed about
            wanting to work comfortably in their own home.
            One of them said, <em>“I'm just counting down to Friday so I can have the weekend to myself.”</em> Later
            that same day, I attended an A+E Networks media event and
            witnessed a surprising scene. Three employees playing ping pong with one another. Though they kept missing
            the ball, the trio were having a blast with one another.
            Witnessing these events on the same day made me realize something. Gen Z wants to be in jobs where they can
            feel liberation.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Gen Z's demand for work-life balance</h4>
          <p>For Gen Z, flexibility isn't a perk, it's a priority for them. We've seen what the lack of flexibility does
            to people. From people ranting on TikTok or even talking
            about it in their actual workplace. Some even have emotional meltdowns online. In a 2024 study conducted by
            LinkedIn, <strong>73% of Gen Z have left or considered leaving a job</strong>
            that didn't have flexible policies. A 2024 Deloitte report adds that 63% prefer hybrid work for better
            work-life balance. When it comes to time, Gen Z are drawing boundaries. To them their
            time is worth more than gold, something they can't get back. They see this as a necessary step to maintain
            their mental health and productivity. It's a plea to avoid the cycles of exhaustion
            that previous generations endured and viewed as normal.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Purpose Versus Paycheck</h4>
          <p>People from older generations think of jobs as climbing up the corporate ladder. However, the younger
            audience has a different take. They tie their work to purpose instead
            of a paycheck. According to a study conducted by Deloitte Global, 86% of Gen Zers want a sense of purpose in
            their work. Shockingly, in a Pew Research Study, 70% say that they
            are willing to be paid less to work for organizations whose values align with theirs. These values include
            things like environmental impact, diversity (DEI), mental health advocacy,
            and more. 44% mentioned how they were willing to reject a job offer if the company's ideals clash with
            theirs. It's evident that there's a shift from wanting just a paycheck to instead
            wanting a purpose and change. Gen Z views themselves as stakeholders rather than just workers.</p>
          <br>
          <h4> The Shift In Workplace Culture</h4>
          <p>To older generations, asking for a nap room, ping-pong, or even pet friendly environments at work sounds
            frivolous. To Gen Z these “frivolous” ideas are a symbol of respect. At the A+E
            media event, I saw firsthand how a joyful environment promotes both productivity and collaboration.</p>
          <p>The truth of the matter is this generation values mental health, flexibility, and community just as much as
            salary and benefits, sometimes even more. In a New York Post survey, nearly
            1 in 6 Gen-Zers won't consider a job without a designated nap space at their workplace. 1 in 5 Gen Z workers
            say having a "fun room" with games is essential. 33% of Gen Z expect free snacks
            and lunches at work, more than any other group.</p>
          <p>Even with perks companies may offer, many still resist returning to traditional office settings. 1 in 4
            people want extended sabbaticals for personal development or even travel. 20% won't
            consider a job unless the office allows pets. These "frivolous" ideas allow people to integrate work,
            wellness, and passion together. In fact, at the A+E media event, Paul Bucceri talked about
            how he didn't believe in work-life balance. He instead, found ways to integrate his life with work. He once
            took his daughters out of school for a road trip while working.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Let People Breathe </h4>
          <p> Overall, Gen Z's expectations at work may seem to be idealistic. However, they have experienced the
            pandemic, social justice issues, burnout and other issues. This isn't about finding ways to
            do less work, rather it is about finding a system that nurtures their productivity. If employers decide to
            ignore these pleas they risk missing out on a generation who are socially aware and mentally
            conscious. Instead, let's stop trying to cling onto outdated norms and start building a workforce based on
            new innovative ideas.</p>

            that same day, I attended an A+E Networks media event and
            witnessed a surprising scene. Three employees playing ping pong with one another. Though they kept missing
            the ball, the trio were having a blast with one another.
            Witnessing these events on the same day made me realize something. Gen Z wants to be in jobs where they can
            feel liberation.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Gen Z's demand for work-life balance</h4>
          <p>For Gen Z, flexibility isn't a perk, it's a priority for them. We've seen what the lack of flexibility does
            to people. From people ranting on TikTok or even talking
            about it in their actual workplace. Some even have emotional meltdowns online. In a 2024 study conducted by
            LinkedIn, <strong>73% of Gen Z have left or considered leaving a job</strong>
            that didn't have flexible policies. A 2024 Deloitte report adds that 63% prefer hybrid work for better
            work-life balance. When it comes to time, Gen Z are drawing boundaries. To them their
            time is worth more than gold, something they can't get back. They see this as a necessary step to maintain
            their mental health and productivity. It's a plea to avoid the cycles of exhaustion
            that previous generations endured and viewed as normal.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Purpose Versus Paycheck</h4>
          <p>People from older generations think of jobs as climbing up the corporate ladder. However, the younger
            audience has a different take. They tie their work to purpose instead
            of a paycheck. According to a study conducted by Deloitte Global, 86% of Gen Zers want a sense of purpose in
            their work. Shockingly, in a Pew Research Study, 70% say that they
            are willing to be paid less to work for organizations whose values align with theirs. These values include
            things like environmental impact, diversity (DEI), mental health advocacy,
            and more. 44% mentioned how they were willing to reject a job offer if the company's ideals clash with
            theirs. It's evident that there's a shift from wanting just a paycheck to instead
            wanting a purpose and change. Gen Z views themselves as stakeholders rather than just workers.</p>
          <br>
          <h4> The Shift In Workplace Culture</h4>
          <p>To older generations, asking for a nap room, ping-pong, or even pet friendly environments at work sounds
            frivolous. To Gen Z these “frivolous” ideas are a symbol of respect. At the A+E
            media event, I saw firsthand how a joyful environment promotes both productivity and collaboration.</p>
          <p>The truth of the matter is this generation values mental health, flexibility, and community just as much as
            salary and benefits, sometimes even more. In a New York Post survey, nearly
            1 in 6 Gen-Zers won't consider a job without a designated nap space at their workplace. 1 in 5 Gen Z workers
            say having a "fun room" with games is essential. 33% of Gen Z expect free snacks
            and lunches at work, more than any other group.</p>
          <p>Even with perks companies may offer, many still resist returning to traditional office settings. 1 in 4
            people want extended sabbaticals for personal development or even travel. 20% won't
            consider a job unless the office allows pets. These "frivolous" ideas allow people to integrate work,
            wellness, and passion together. In fact, at the A+E media event, Paul Bucceri talked about
            how he didn't believe in work-life balance. He instead, found ways to integrate his life with work. He once
            took his daughters out of school for a road trip while working.</p>
          <br>
          <h4>Let People Breathe </h4>
          <p> Overall, Gen Z's expectations at work may seem to be idealistic. However, they have experienced the
            pandemic, social justice issues, burnout and other issues. This isn't about finding ways to
            do less work, rather it is about finding a system that nurtures their productivity. If employers decide to
            ignore these pleas they risk missing out on a generation who are socially aware and mentally
            conscious. Instead, let's stop trying to cling onto outdated norms and start building a workforce based on
            new innovative ideas.</p>

          <h2> Gen Z in the Workplace<br></h2>
          <h3>By: Karlens Viltus </h3>
          <br>

          <p>As Generation Z steps into the workforce, they’re bringing a new set of expectations that are shifting the
            culture of employment. Unlike previous generations who prioritized job security, longevity, and climbing the
            corporate ladder, Gen Z is focused on purpose, flexibility, mental health, inclusion, transparency, and
            growth. These priorities aren’t based on entitlement, but rather on the social, economic, and technological
            environment they grew up in. This generation has come of age in a world marked by climate change, racial
            justice movements, student debt, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the rise of artificial intelligence. As a
            result, they have redefined what a fulfilling and sustainable career looks like.
            <br><br>
            One of the strongest expectations Gen Z holds is that work must carry meaning. According to Deloitte’s 2024
            Global Gen Z and Millennial Survey, 86% of Gen Z respondents said that having a sense of purpose is a key
            factor when choosing an employer (Deloitte, 2024). Gen Z wants to work for companies that do more than
            generate profit — they want to contribute to something that matters. One student I interviewed shared, “I
            need to feel like what I’m doing actually matters. I don’t want to work somewhere that just cares about
            profit.” This sentiment reflects a broader desire among young professionals to align their careers with
            their personal values, whether that’s sustainability, equity, or community impact. When companies fall short
            of this alignment, Gen Z isn’t afraid to disengage or walk away.
            <br><br>
            Flexibility is another non-negotiable. The pandemic showed this generation that traditional office models
            aren’t the only way to be productive. As a result, remote and hybrid work structures are now seen as
            standard. A report by McKinsey & Company found that 77% of Gen Z workers prefer hybrid or remote
            arrangements and consider flexibility a critical component of job satisfaction (McKinsey & Company, 2022).
            Another interviewee stated, “I want flexibility, like the option to work from home at least part of the
            week. I don’t see myself doing a strict 9 to 5 every day in an office.” For Gen Z, flexible work signals
            trust and autonomy. It allows them to structure their days in ways that support both their personal lives
            and productivity, which can, in turn, build loyalty to the employer.
            <br><br>
            In addition to flexibility, mental health support is a major priority. The American Psychological
            Association reported in 2023 that Gen Z experiences higher levels of stress than any other generation,
            largely due to work-related anxiety and financial uncertainty (APA, 2023). As a result, this generation
            expects mental health resources to be built into their benefits. One respondent emphasized this need,
            saying, “For me, mental health benefits are just as important as the salary. If I’m burnt out, I won’t be
            productive anyway.” Employers that offer counseling, mental health days, and emotionally intelligent
            leadership are more likely to retain Gen Z workers, while those who fail to support emotional well-being
            risk high turnover and disengagement.
            <br><br>
            Diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are also top concerns. A 2023 survey by Monster found that 83% of
            Gen Z candidates consider a company’s commitment to DEI as a major factor in accepting a job offer (Monster,
            2023). Gen Z expects meaningful representation at all levels of leadership, inclusive hiring practices, and
            safe environments for people of all identities. But they also demand authenticity. If a company makes
            surface-level DEI claims without action, they’re likely to be called out — often publicly. Gen Z is unafraid
            to use social media as a tool for accountability, and performative behavior is quickly exposed.
            <br><br>
            Professional development is another key expectation. Gen Z doesn’t want to be stuck in repetitive roles
            with no clear path forward. Instead, they want consistent feedback, mentorship, and access to learning
            opportunities. According to LinkedIn’s Workforce Confidence Index, 76% of Gen Z professionals believe that
            ongoing learning is essential to career success (LinkedIn, 2022). One peer I spoke to said, “I expect
            regular feedback and chances to grow. If I’m stuck doing the same thing for a year, I’m gone.” This
            generation views skill-building not just as a career benefit, but as a necessity for survival in an
            ever-changing job market. Transparency and communication from leadership also matter. Gen Z wants honesty
            about company performance, expectations, and decisions that impact their roles. PwC’s 2023 Future of Work
            report found that Gen Z employees value open conversations with managers, including regular feedback and
            clarity on goals (PwC, 2023). Given that they’ve grown up with constant access to information online, they
            expect the same openness within their workplaces. Companies that lack transparency risk damaging the trust
            Gen Z considers foundational.
            <br><br>
            Finally, Gen Z’s expectations are being shaped by the growing influence of artificial intelligence on
            hiring and job security. Several of the students I interviewed expressed frustration about AI’s role in the
            application process. One shared, “It’s crazy. Entry-level jobs now require three years of experience, or
            worse, they’re just being automated.” Another said, “I’ve applied to over 50 jobs and barely heard back.
            Sometimes I wonder if a bot even looked at my résumé.” These quotes reveal a sense of discouragement and
            anxiety, particularly for recent graduates who feel overshadowed by algorithms and automation. “It’s like I
            studied for four years just to lose out to a robot in the application process,” one student said. Another
            added, “I feel like AI is moving faster than schools can teach us. We’re graduating behind.”
            <br><br>
            In conclusion, Gen Z’s workplace expectations reflect a shift toward a more human-centered, value-driven,
            and transparent approach to employment. They want flexibility, purpose, mental health support, DEI, growth,
            and honesty. These are not demands for special treatment, but rather a reflection of how the world has
            changed and what a sustainable, fulfilling career now looks like. Employers who adapt to these expectations
            will not only attract top Gen Z talent but will build stronger, more resilient organizations for the future.

            A quiet game about choices, silence, and being seen. In this game, you step into the story of a student
            navigating the unspoken codes of opportunity—applications, rejections, performance, and the subtle rules
            that shape belonging. Each decision branches from emotion, not strategy. Whether you apply or not, speak
            or
            stay silent, the game holds space for all paths. This is not a game to win. It’s a space to feel your way
            through. To be seen—even when you don’t say a word.

            You're about to graduate high school… Now what? Post-Grad Pathfinder is an interactive story game where
            you
            explore real-world decisions about life after high school. Whether you’re headed to college, looking for a
            job, considering a gap year, or unsure about your major, this game places you in the shoes of a graduating
            Fellow navigating these paths. Through conversations with mentors, experiences on campus, internships,
            peer
            advice, and even moments of doubt, you’ll uncover what feels right for you. The game is built to reflect
            real-life complexities, there’s no one-size-fits-all route here. Make choices, gather knowledge, and carve
            out your next chapter on your terms.

            In the game, the player has an upcoming interview in two days for an internship they applied for, but they
            have never done an interview before. They have a variety of choices to choose from in order to prepare
            them
            for the interview. But be careful as they take up your time depending on the choices you made. You may or
            may not be able to go through all the choices, and different choices will lead to different levels of
            preparedness, which is important when the day for the interview comes. Depending on your choices,
            especially
            on interview day, you may secure the internship position. Good luck!
