      <p class="title">Degrees Without Direction</p>
      <p class="introductionParagraph">In today's landscape, higher education is often sold as the golden ticket to stability. Yet recent data challenge that assumption. The unemployment rate for young college graduates aged 22 to 27 stood at **5.8 percent in March 2025**, nearly twice the **4 percent** national average. Not to mention that applicants have risen by over 30 percent leading to larger competition for these entry level positions.</p>
      <p class="introductionParagraph">Meanwhile, early-career underemployment, working in jobs that don't require a degree, affects **about 41 percent** of recent grads. These figures indicate a clear call for a systemic reform aimed to propel the work new graduates can do to a degree beyond what is simply replaceable.</p>

          <p>The mismatch isn't caused by student laziness. Instead, it's the product of entrenched institutional and economic shifts.</p>
          <p><strong>1. Academic misalignment with labor demand</strong> Fields like communications, arts, and social sciences carry some of the highest unemployment and underemployment rate. Georgetown's CEW reports that humanities majors, for example, can face underemployment rates over <strong>50 percent</strong>. Conversely, technical and healthcare fields continue to grow.</p>
          <p><strong>2. The rise of skill-first hiring and AI disruption</strong> Employers increasingly care about skills over diplomas. Giants like IBM and Google now favor demonstrated ability, not just degrees. Meanwhile, AI is automating many entry-level jobs including routine programming and legal-assistant roles displacing new graduates.</p>
          <p><strong>3. Institutional inertia</strong> Universities remain bound to legacy models: emphasizing degree completion over career readiness. Graduate employment rates can typically lack transparency allowing for alterations which demonstrate entirely separate information, even career counseling is superficial in many cases.</p>
          <p><strong>4. Structural economic headwinds</strong> We're entering what some call a "no‑hire, no‑fire" economy. Hiring has slowed to 2014's pace even as layoffs remain minimal. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York labels current conditions "deteriorating," with the entry-level job pipeline particularly thin.</p>

          <p><strong>Proposed Solutions</strong></p>
          <p>To restore the promise of higher education, we must rebuild the bridge between schooling and sustainable careers:</p>
          <p>1. <strong>Curricular integration with real-world skills</strong> Embed internships, co-ops, and industry partnerships into degree programs, ensuring graduates emerge job-ready with the skills needed to be helpful at a company.</p>
          <p>2. <strong>Transparent outcome metrics</strong> Mandate universities to publicly report employment, wage, and underemployment rates by major enabling informed student choices. Transparency in data urges these institutions to focus on the problems that new graduates face when looking for employment.</p>
          <p>3. <strong>Diversified education pathways</strong> Normalize alternatives like vocational training, coding bootcamps, apprenticeships as respected and viable as traditional college. Allowing for alternatives would help unemployment issues while providing pathways for those who wouldn't like to seek a degree.</p>
          <p>4. <strong>Strategic funding alignment</strong> Direct public scholarships and loan forgiveness toward high-demand sectors like healthcare, renewable energy, and tech allowing for economically challenged students to still be able to obtain a degree with the financial burdens.</p>
          <p>5. <strong>AI-era support systems</strong> Invest in mentorship programs and ongoing training, countering the de-personalization effects of automation.</p>

          <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong></p>
          <p>Unaddressed, this issue will ripple through our economy: delayed financial independence, suppressed consumer spending, and weaker middle-class growth. As a whole, alongside the quality of life plummeting, businesses would have a difficult time staying afloat with the decreased spending and many would be crushed under overbearing debt.</p>
          <p>Higher education should do more than confer degrees, it should equip individuals to meaningfully contribute to society and support themselves. Today's graduates deserve more than empty credentials; they deserve a future.</p>
          <p><strong>Call to Action:</strong> The opportunity network has provided countless resources proving their dedication to help fellows succeed in the world that has found less space for those looking to be part of it. Not only does the opportunity network have a site expressly to help those who are struggling with their next steps, but it aims to boost to be the best that you are capable of.</p>
          <p>Not only does the site provide insights on crucial foundations such as, Resume & Cover Letter Support, Networking, Interview Prep, Skill Development, and even an Alumni page, but it allows those who have gone beyond that to find part-time jobs or bigger opportunities. An even greater help that they strive to give are their supports through dedicated members there to help fellows in times of need.</p>

            A quiet game about choices, silence, and being seen. In this game, you step into the story of a student
            navigating the unspoken codes of opportunity—applications, rejections, performance, and the subtle rules
            that shape belonging. Each decision branches from emotion, not strategy. Whether you apply or not, speak or
            stay silent, the game holds space for all paths. This is not a game to win. It's a space to feel your way
            through. To be seen—even when you don't say a word.

            job, considering a gap year, or unsure about your major, this game places you in the shoes of a graduating
            Fellow navigating these paths. Through conversations with mentors, experiences on campus, internships, peer
            advice, and even moments of doubt, you'll uncover what feels right for you. The game is built to reflect
            real-life complexities, there's no one-size-fits-all route here. Make choices, gather knowledge, and carve

            In the game, the player has an upcoming interview in two days for an internship they applied for, but they
            have never done an interview before. They have a variety of choices to choose from in order to prepare them
            for the interview. But be careful as they take up your time depending on the choices you made. You may or
            may not be able to go through all the choices, and different choices will lead to different levels of
            preparedness, which is important when the day for the interview comes. Depending on your choices, especially
            on interview day, you may secure the internship position. Good luck!
