This README.md contains a few instructions for how to clone a repository, push to a repository, and make commits.
## Cloning a repository
See https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository?tool=desktop for more detail

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Above the list of files, click <>Code.
3. To clone and open the repository with GitHub Desktop, click Open with GitHub Desktop.
4. Follow the prompts in GitHub Desktop to complete the clone.
## Viewing branches
1. On **GitHub**, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. From the file tree view on the left, select the branch dropdown menu, then click View all branches. You can also find the branch dropdown menu at the top of the integrated file editor.
3. Use the navigation at the top of the page to view specific lists of branches:
    - **Your branches**: In repositories that you have push access to, the Yours view shows all branches that youâ€™ve pushed to, excluding the default branch, with the most recent branches first.
    - **Active branches**: The Active view shows all branches (excluding the default branch) that anyone has committed to within the last three months, ordered by the branches with the most recent commits first.
    - **Stale branches**: The Stale view shows all branches that no one has committed to in the last three months, ordered by the branches with the oldest commits first. Use this list to determine which branches to delete.
    - **All branches**: The All view shows the default branch, followed by all other branches ordered by the branches with the most recent commits first.
4. Optionally, use the search field on the top right. It provides a simple, case-insensitive, sub-string search on the branch name. It does not support any additional query syntax.
## Forking a repository
See https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository for more
1. In the File menu, click Clone Repository.
2. Click the tab that corresponds to the location of the repository you want to clone. In this example, we click on the URL tab.
3. Enter the url or path of the repository you want to clone.
4. To select the local directory into which you want to clone the repository, next to the "Local Path" field, click Choose... and navigate to the directory.
5. At the bottom of the "Clone a Repository" window, click Clone.
6. To create a fork, attempt to push a change to the repository. For example, create a new branch and publish it. A prompt will appear asking if you want to fork this repository.
7. Read the information in the "How are you planning to use this fork?" window.
    - If you plan to use this fork for contributing to the original upstream repository, click To contribute to the parent project.
    - If you plan to use this fork for a project not connected to the upstream, click For my own purposes.
8. Click Continue.
